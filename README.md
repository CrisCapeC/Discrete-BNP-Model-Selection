All codes contain file paths according to my own code. You should try to change it.

For "Monte Carlo study - All scenarios", the Rcpp functions must be loaded before running.

For "Monte Carlo study - Supplementary", it is not necessary to have such functions. For count data, a function to perform a stepwise algorithm under zero-inflated models was written.

For "Data application", the binary and categorical datasets are available in the UCI repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/, while the count data is available in the R package AER.
