The current repository contains the necessary codes for the Monte Carlo Study and the Data application sections of the article "A Bayesian Nonparametric Model Selection Procedure for Discrete Data" and its supplementary file.

All codes contain file paths according to our own code. You should try to change it.

For "Monte Carlo study - All scenarios", the Rcpp functions must be loaded before running. For "Monte Carlo study - Supplementary", it is not necessary to have such functions. For count data, a function to perform a stepwise algorithm under zero-inflated models was created. That's why it represents the longest part of the code.

For "Data application", both datasets are available in the UCI repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/.
